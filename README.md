 Hi I`m Marcin, i started learning programming and other IT technologies at my studiesðŸ˜„ but mostly, i learned by myself.
 
 My main known language is Python
 I learned CSS and HTML and JavaScript at some point.
 
 I learning/i would learn Java Script more because i`m sure this take my web application made in Flask or Django to the next level.
