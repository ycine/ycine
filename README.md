 Hi I`m Marcin, i started learning programming and other IT technologies at my studiesðŸ˜„ but mostly, i learned by myself.
 
 My main known language is Python <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iconfinder.com%2Ficons%2F4518857%2Fpython_icon&psig=AOvVaw2YVtPw0T1STneHmJ6_ZMdH&ust=1669927642471000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCJjYorHj1vsCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE" width=50% height=50%>

 I learned CSS  <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flaticon.com%2Ffree-icon%2Fcss-3_732190&psig=AOvVaw3fx2Wt6ZRXFwq0wrxB-bVy&ust=1669927844862000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDp9pHk1vsCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE" width=50% height=50%>and HTML <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/732/732212.png" width=50% height=50%> and JavaScript  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/5968/5968292.png" width=50% height=50%>at some point.
 
 I learning/i would learn Java Script more because i`m sure this take my web application made in Flask or Django to the next level.
