 Hi I`m Marcin, i started learning programming and other IT technologies at my studies😄 but mostly, i learned by myself.
 
 My main known language is Python <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/5968/5968350.png" height=5% width=5% >

 I learned CSS  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/732/732190.png" height=5% width=5%>and HTML <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/174/174854.png" height=5% width=5%> and JavaScript  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/5968/5968292.png" height=5% width=5%>at some point.
 
 I learning/i would learn Java Script more because i`m sure this take my web application made in Flask or Django to the next level.
