### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**ycine/ycine** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


 Hi I`m Marcin, i started learning programming and other IT technologies at my studiesðŸ˜„ but mostly, i learned by myself.
 
 My main known language is Python
 I learned CSS and HTML and JavaScript at some point.
 
 I learning/i would learn Java Script more because i`m sure this take my web application made in Flask or Django to the next level.
